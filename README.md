# Data science algorithms from scratch
Data science algorithm from scratch implementent during DataRoot trainee program.
In project was used only **numpy** for matrix manipulation and **sklearn** for comparing results.

**Implemented:**
- Decision tree
- Gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA)
- Gaussian maximum likelihood classifier
- K-means
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Naive Bayes classifier
- Principal component analisys (PCA)
